## What is life to me??

<br/>It’s one thing to be alive, but it’s another to actually be living. As humans, we have the choice to go through the motions, watching the days go by, or we can really embrace the life around us. It’s easier than you think to fall in the routine of the first option.
<br/>I’m not going to lie, I’ve lived a majority of my life that way. However recently I’ve been making a conscious effort to wake up each morning with a new goal: to actually live my life. I want to experience it all. I want to experience happiness from everything around me, big and small. However with this mindset, I have to expect to have my share of misfortune-- that is part of living. Something I’ve come to realize is that I cannot have the mindset that life is only full of happy things. The reality is, it isn’t. But this doesn’t mean I can’t live a happy life. It’s completely possible to live a happy life while dealing with problems. That’s one huge lesson I’ve learned.
<br/>So what exactly does life mean to me?

<br/>Life is the little things. There are so many things that we all experience. We all turn 18, we all go to college, we all get married, etc. These are big things. They don’t differentiate us, though. Some people, including myself once, mistakenly defined life by milestones. Granted, these milestones are very important. But what often gets forgotten are those little things. The things that make us who we are, the things that make those milestones all the more special.
<br/>Life is the pictures that you take at the most serene places of your vacations. Life is your favorite character on your current TV show. Life is the smile on your friends and family’s faces when they open the gift you picked out especially for them. Life is that impressive grade you got on a test after studying your ass off. Life is seeing your best friend after months of being apart. Life is then laying on the floor with your best friend in silence, not needing any words to fill the space-- each other’s presence is enough. Life is the ability to laugh until your stomach hurts. Life is driving around your silent neighborhood for hours with your friends, just because you aren’t ready to go home. Life is taking risks, like having your friend cut your hair seven inches spontaneously. Life is not caring what other’s think of you, but being content with who you have become as a person.

<br/>At the end of the day, what you have is yourself. The sooner we realize that and come to love ourselves, the sooner we will realize what life is really all about.
