## _Who are you? When nobody is around_
---

<br/>You feel like the whole world is caving in on you,
<br/>Someone in you, is pushing you off the cliff.
<br/>You know what you're running from,
<br/>but don't know what you're searching for.
<br/>All you see, are the faces watching you fall,
<br/>but tell me something;
<br/>Who are you? When nobody is around.
