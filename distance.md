## To: The distance between us
---
They say long distance never work, and I think that's stupid.
<br>Hearts pick people not places and it kills me that your place happens to be 8987km away,
<br>But that doesn’t mean I don’t love you like you live next door, and it also doesn’t mean that its not hard for me, I’ve never missed someone so deeply who I haven’t actually lost and missing you is one of the hardest things that I have ever had to do.
<br>
<br>Watching all the other couples get to have their little things like goodbye kisses or falling asleep to the sound of your heartbeat instead of goodnight texts and calls, but it is all worth it the moment I run into your arms and I’m home again.
<br>
<br>It drives me crazy not being able to be there with you, but it would be worst simply not to be yours at all. 
<br>So, I will wait as long as it takes, i will fight as hard as you need and i will love you as deep as I can, because 10-hour plane flight is a small price to pay for the forever which I can't wait to spend with you.
<br>
<br>So, I’ll find comfort in pictures of us and I’ll tuck myself into the thought of how I’ll feel when I have you in my arms again.
