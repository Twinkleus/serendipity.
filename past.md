## A peek to my past
---
One’s mind is the most nostalgic place ever.
<br>It’s creepy, interesting, beautiful and sad all at the same time
when you dig into those minds.
<br>
<br>Lemme share a peek to my past…
<br>Childhood is the most precious time in everyone’s life, but I
think it definitely doesn’t define who we are now.
<br>Nevertheless, it can be said that the inner child is kept alive by 
childhood memories.
<br>
<br>I was born and brought up in a very adorable family, I am the 
only child and my parents are my best friends since I was 
born.
<br>I don’t remember much of my early childhood…
<br>As a kid I was very naive, sensitive and stubborn and I had 
serious attachment towards my parents.
<br>That reminds me of the first day of my school, I think that was 
back in 2005 or 6…..
<br>Both my mom and dad came to drop me off to the school 
since it was the first day, they stayed until the first bell go off 
but…. as sooooon as they left my site, I literally bolted out of 
the classroom ignoring everyone, crying and yelling 
“moommm don’t leave me alone!!!...” how embarrassing
lol… my class teacher had to drag me to the classroom from 
my parents and this went on pretty much for like half sem XD
<br>After sometime, I got settled, got friends and so on.
Many people crossed my life… some good… some bad…. 
Some also gave me very good life lessons.
<br>
<br>Then comes the early teenage, as a high schooler I was pretty 
much an introvert, but I was very good in academics also I
was a classical dancer and a hella stubborn-ass, if I fixed my 
mind on something I wouldn’t stop until I get it!!
<br>Anyhow, I had a very few friends back then thanks to them I
was not a complete loner.
<br>If I say I don’t remember any happy memories from my 
school days that pretty much explains it.
<br>At that time, I wanted to be someone cool, a person who 
everyone wants to be with.
<br>Trying to be someone who you’re not only makes you look 
pathetic. Anyways…
<br>
<br>After that came the most exciting and beautiful part of my 
life. I was no longer that pathetic girl with braces who craved 
for the warmth of friendship..
<br>By that time, I already found the people who brought that 
warmth in my life.
<br>It was back in 2016-17.. I got these two crackhead and 
beautiful souls (T and H) who loved me, cared for me and 
supported me both mentally and emotionally…
<br>We used to do all the crazy things any teenager would 
do…skipping the classes, drives without destination, 
sleepovers many more things which I couldn’t experience 
before.
<br>Crazy part is they know me more than I know myself!!
I hope everyone have atleast one person like this in their life.
<br>
<br>Then I met the person who is now the biggest part of my life, 
a person who accepted me for who I was and puts up with all 
my craziness.
<br>Even tho we spent a very short time together, it happened to 
be the happiest and exciting time of my life which I can never 
forget!
<br>Believe me, getting accepted by someone for who you are and 
who doesn’t care about your insecurities, encourages you for 
all the things you wanna do in life and makes you feel like 
you’re the luckiest person!!!
<br>DON’T LOSE THAT HUMAN!!!
<br>
<br>Aaannnnnddddddd currently, I came a long way and I’m a girl 
who know exactly what she wants and where she’s going..
<br>If you’re still reading this till here.. I just wanna say you’re 
hella jobless… just kidding! XD
